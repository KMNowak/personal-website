# Experienced JavaScript Developer specializing in scalable web and mobile applications

I am a skilled JavaScript Developer with a proven track record of over 6 years in building scalable web and mobile applications.
My expertise lies in utilizing **TypeScript**, **React**, and **React Native** to create robust and efficient software solutions. With a strong command of **Node.js** and **Nest.js**, I am capable of seamlessly developing backends that perfectly complement these frontend and mobile technologies.

My passion lies in transforming ideas into reality through agile and high-quality development practices. I prioritize the results, relevance, and quality of the solutions I create, ensuring they meet the unique requirements of each project.

Drawing from my extensive experience in developing more than 10 commercial applications, including projects built entirely from the ground up, I bring a wealth of knowledge to the table. I have also actively engaged in business consultations, domain modeling sessions, and product discovery workshops, allowing me to harness valuable insights and deliver tailored solutions.

When approaching any project, my main focus is on identifying the most suitable solutions that align with the specific needs of the business. Moreover, I am a highly communicative and responsible team player who values collaboration and maintains a people-oriented approach. Timely delivery of results is of utmost importance to me.
